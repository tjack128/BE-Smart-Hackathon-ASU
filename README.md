The SCW Covid-19 Sensor is a Wearable Configurable Detector/Scanner Blockchain-Artificial-Intelligence Network that can test for coronavirus and return results in 20 minutes. The resources used to implement this system include IBM z15 mainframe, Hybrid Cloud Manager, and Medical Provenance Blockchain/Artificial Intelligence System:

· IBM z15 mainframe will be housed in IBM’s Secure Data Center or a Secure Government Center.

· A Hybrid Cloud Manager is used to enable data exchange from different sources and different clouds. Our System will work with databased and Electronic Medical records Systems working on different platforms

· Medical Provenance Blockchain/AI system is used to securely and accurately record every test data received from the Covid-19 wearable configurable scanner.

The Covid-19 Sensor App is based on magnetic particle imaging (MPI) which has emerged as a non-invasive tomographic technique that has proven useful in diagnostic imaging. The diagnostic imaging is used to detect the Covid -19 magnetic frequency that is within everyone’s DNA.
